# Day 03 — Go CLI Tool for Directory Scanning

## Objective
Build a simple command-line tool using Go to explore filesystem structure.

## Why Go?
Go is widely used in cloud-native systems due to:
- static binaries
- strong concurrency support
- predictable performance

## What this tool does
- Accepts a directory path
- Traverses the directory recursively
- Reports file and directory counts

## Key concepts practiced
- Static typing
- Error handling
- CLI arguments
- Building standalone binaries
