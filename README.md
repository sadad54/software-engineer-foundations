# Software Engineer Foundations

This repository documents my structured journey to become a production-ready Software Engineer,
with focus on systems, cloud-native development, and engineering best practices.

## Why this repository exists
I may be early in my career, but I believe strong engineering habits,
clear documentation, and continuous learning matter more than years alone.

This repo reflects:
- My daily learning process
- Engineering decisions and tradeoffs
- Hands-on system-level work

## Tech focus
- Linux environments
- Git & version control
- Python & Go
- Containers & cloud-native systems
