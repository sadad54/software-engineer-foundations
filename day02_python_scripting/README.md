# Day 02 — Python Scripting for Automation

## Objective
Use Python as an automation tool to inspect and report filesystem information.

## Script Overview
The script recursively scans a directory and reports:
- Total number of files
- Total number of directories
- Total disk usage

## Why this matters
Filesystem inspection is a common requirement in:
- backend services
- cloud infrastructure debugging
- deployment pipelines

## Key concepts practiced
- Command-line arguments
- Recursive directory traversal
- Defensive input handling
- Clean, readable output
